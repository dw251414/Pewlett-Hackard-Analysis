## Conclusion

Seeing a majority of PH's workforce is either retirment or mentorship-eligible - the next 5-10 years is crucial in terms of replenishing talent. They will have to allocate financial investment, and sweat equity to address this growing need via training, further-education, recruiting ...etc. The aspiring Mentorship Program is a wise idea to get started - grassroots/academy-talent is attractive and lucrative. Our queries, and tables provide insights on the hard numbers and details here - mentorship-specifically: a list of these employees, time spent with Pewlett Hackard, as well as a track record of their positions while at the company.
